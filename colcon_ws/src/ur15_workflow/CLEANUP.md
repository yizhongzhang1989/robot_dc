# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed

All workflow-related files outside the ROS package have been removed to keep the workspace clean and modular.

### Removed Files/Directories:

1. **`ur15_workflow/`** (project root) - Standalone Python package
   - Removed entire directory with all modules

2. **`scripts/`** directory:
   - `workflow_engine.py` - Moved to ROS package
   - `operation_handlers.py` - Moved to ROS package  
   - `robot_workflow_runner.py` - Moved to ROS package

3. **`config/`** directory:
   - `workflow_example.yaml` - Moved to ROS package
   - `workflow_simple.yaml` - Moved to ROS package

4. **`doc/`** directory:
   - `workflow_architecture.md` - Consolidated into ROS package docs

5. **Project root**:
   - `run_workflow.py` - Convenience script (no longer needed)

## What Remains

Only the ROS 2 package in the colcon workspace:

```
colcon_ws/src/ur15_workflow/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── package.xml
├── setup.py
├── setup.cfg
├── README.md
├── QUICKSTART.md
├── PACKAGE_INFO.md
├── resource/

├── ur15_workflow/              # Python package

```

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All workflow code is now in one place (ROS package)
2. **Standard ROS 2 Structure**: Follows ROS conventions and best practices
3. **Clean Workspace**: No duplicate or scattered files
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Update only the ROS package
5. **Better Integration**: Works seamlessly with colcon build system
6. **Proper Packaging**: Can be distributed as a standard ROS package

## Verification

✅ **ROS Package Intact**: `colcon_ws/src/ur15_workflow/` contains all necessary files
✅ **Build Works**: Package builds successfully with `colcon build`
✅ **Execution Works**: Scripts run correctly with `ros2 run`
✅ **Configuration Accessible**: Config files in standard ROS share directory
✅ **No External Dependencies**: All workflow code self-contained in package

## Usage After Cleanup

Everything now works through the ROS package:

```bash
# Build (if needed after changes)
cd ~/Documents/robot_dc/colcon_ws
colcon build --packages-select ur15_workflow

# Source workspace
source ~/Documents/robot_dc/colcon_ws/install/setup.bash

# Run workflows
ros2 run ur15_workflow run_workflow.py \
  --config $(ros2 pkg prefix ur15_workflow)/share/ur15_workflow/examples/workflow_simple.yaml
```

## Documentation

All documentation is now in the ROS package:
- **README.md**: Complete usage guide
- **QUICKSTART.md**: Quick reference
- **PACKAGE_INFO.md**: Setup and verification details
- **This file**: Cleanup summary

---

The workflow system is now fully modularized within the ROS 2 package structure.
